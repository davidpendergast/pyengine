|  Ghast's Special Pygame Engine  |
*---------------------------------*

Todo:

Refactoring:
- Let you launch games directly, without going through entry_point.py
	- But probably keep entry_point.py because make_exe sorta needs it
- Redo song fading stuff (no need to use threads probably)

New Features:
- Joystick stuff?
