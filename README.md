# pyengine

Note: This isn't meant for public use. It has bugs, it's not well documented, and it's not very good.

This repo contains some of the utility functions I use throughout my pygame projects.

In particular:
 - Quick and easy OpenGL setup.
 - Window creation, resizing, and fullscreen management.
 - Automatic pixel scaling based on window size.
 - A layer-based sprite rendering pipeline.
 - Some helpful methods involving music & sounds. 
 
 There's also a tiny demo project to help illustrate the setup.
